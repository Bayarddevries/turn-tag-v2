# AGENTS.md — Chase Tag

## Project Overview

**Circle Chase** is a 2-player turn-based physics evasion game built with React + TypeScript + Vite. One player is the Hider, the other is the Seeker. The Hider tries to survive as long as possible; the Seeker tries to tag them. Built as a local hotseat pass-and-play game.

**Repository:** https://github.com/Bayarddevries/Circle-Chase

**Tech Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6, TailwindCSS 4, Canvas API

**Design Philosophy:** "Neon Night Golf Chase" — high-contrast dark theme with amber/emerald neon accents, cinematic physics, procedural map generation

## Architecture

### Game Flow

```
menu → round_intro → playing → round_over → (next round or match_over)
                                    ↓
                              sudden_death_intro → playing → match_over
```

1. **MainMenu** — Player name input, best-of selector (3/5/7), help button
2. **Round Intro** — Role assignment display (who's Hider/Seeker this round), "ENGAGE" button
3. **Playing** — Canvas-based physics game loop. Players alternate turns (Hider first). Slingshot controls (drag back to aim, release to launch). Round ends when Seeker tags Hider.
4. **Round Over** — Shows turns survived, score update, leaderboard. "PROCEED" button.
5. **Match Over** — Champion declaration, round history log, replay/menu buttons.
6. **Sudden Death** — Tie-breaker round on compact map, no fog of war, first tag wins.

### Physics System

- **Sub-stepping:** 5 physics steps per frame for accuracy
- **Slow-motion:** `slowMotionRef` scales velocity during tag events (value < 1.0)
- **Boundary restitution:** 0.65 normal, 0.93 during slow-mo explosion
- **Bumper restitution:** 1.4x base, 3.0x with Superball power-up
- **Hazards:** Sand patches (extra 8% friction/frame), Ice patches (1% friction/frame)
- **Fog of War:** Hider hidden beyond 350px from Seeker (unless Sonar Pulse active)

### Power-Up System

Single-use orbs spawn in the middle zone. Seeker picks them up by collision:

| Power-Up | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Laser Sight | 2.5x slingshot trajectory preview |
| Superball | 2x bumper/wall bounce intensity |
| Iron Ball | Ignores sand friction |
| Sonar Pulse | Reveals Hider position, removes fog |

**Note:** Power-up balance needs tuning (CC-007). Laser should increase speed. New power-ups planned: Cloak (Hider invisible 3s), Magnet (Seeker pulls Hider).

### Meta-Progression

- **Credits ("Cybernetic Credits"):** earned per round (turns survived × 1.5 if power-up collected)
- **Unskins, trail colors, bumper themes, map backgrounds**: purchasable with credits
- **Leaderboard:** top-10 survival turns (localStorage)
- **Badges:** Sand Dodger, Bounce Master, Quick Tag, First Round, Century Runner, Power Hungry
- **Persistence:** localStorage for all meta state

### Scoring

- Hider earns 1 point per turn survived
- Roles alternate each round (P1 Hider on even rounds)
- Best-of series (3/5/7 rounds)
- Tie after all rounds → Sudden Death (first tag wins)

### Controls

- **Slingshot:** Click/touch and drag backwards from your ball to aim, release to launch
- **Turn alternation:** Hider always goes first each round
- **Turn end:** Next turn starts only when BOTH balls have stopped moving
- **Touch:** `preventDefault()` on all touch handlers prevents mobile scroll

### Performance

- **DPI scaling:** Canvas multiplied by `devicePixelRatio`, context scaled
- **ShadowBlur:** Only large spark particles get shadowBlur (6px); debris/glass render flat
- **Particle cap:** Hard limit of 500 particles; oldest culled
- **Constants:** All magic numbers centralized in `src/constants.ts` for easy tuning

## Engineering Discipline (from Karpathy's CLAUDE.md)

Bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that *your* changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**Test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
